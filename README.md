<h1>Design Principles</h1>

<h3>Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate from what stays the same.</h3>
<h3>Program to an interface, not to an implementation.</h3>
<h3>Favour Composition over Inheritance</h3>
<h3>Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.</h3>
<h3>Classes should be open for extension, and closed for modification.</h3>
