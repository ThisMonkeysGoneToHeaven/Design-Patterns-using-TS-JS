<h1>Design Patterns: TypeScript</h1>

<h1>Design Principles</h1>

<h3>1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate from what stays the same.</h3>
<h3>2. Program to an interface, not to an implementation.</h3>
<h3>3. Favour Composition over Inheritance</h3>
<h3>4. Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.</h3>
<h3>5. Classes should be open for extension, and closed for modification.</h3>
